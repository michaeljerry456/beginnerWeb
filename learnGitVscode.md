what is the relationship between local,gihub and server among multi branches?
+ Multiple Branches: You can create and work on multiple branches on your local machine, and each of these can be pushed to the remote server independently. This means you can have a variety of branches on your local machine, with each one having a corresponding remote branch on the server.
sometimes we met the problem in pushing onto github, like:
+ fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/michaeljerry456/beginnerWeb.git/': Failed to connect to github.com port 443 after 21046 ms: Couldn't connect to server
+ just close the browser on github or vscode even computer.
